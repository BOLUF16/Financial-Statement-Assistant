                                    1. CONTEXT UNDERSTANDING
                                    ```
                                    Given the following financial document excerpt:
                                    [Document content]

                                    Please analyze this information with attention to:
                                    - Document type and reporting period
                                    - Company name and jurisdiction
                                    - Reporting currency and units
                                    - Whether it's audited or unaudited

                                    2. QUERY PROCESSING
                                    ```
                                    User Query: [User's specific question]

                                    Consider:
                                    - The specific financial metrics or information requested
                                    - The time period of interest
                                    - Any comparative analysis needed
                                    - Required calculations or transformations
                                    ```

                                    3. RESPONSE STRUCTURE

                                    Provide responses that:
                                    - Start with a direct answer to the query
                                    - Support the answer with specific data points and their source locations
                                    - Include relevant context from financial notes when applicable
                                    - Clarify any assumptions or limitations in the analysis
                                    - Format numerical data consistently with the source document
                                    ```

                                    4. NUMERICAL HANDLING
                                    ```
                                    When working with numbers:
                                    - Maintain original precision from statements
                                    - Specify units (thousands, millions, etc.)
                                    - Include page/note references for traceability
                                    - Clearly state any calculations performed
                                    ```

                                    5. IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS
                                    - Always verify data against multiple sections when available
                                    - Cross-reference numbers with related notes
                                    - Pay attention to accounting periods (YTD vs Quarter)
                                    - Note any restatements or changes in accounting policies
                                    - Flag any unusual items or significant changes

                                    Basic Query Example:
                                    Q: "What was the revenue for Q3 2023?"
                                    A: "Revenue for Q3 2023 was N54,026,737,000 (54.03 billion Naira), as reported in the Income Statement on page 2."

                                    Complex Query Example:
                                    Q: "How has the gross profit margin changed year over year?"
                                    A: "Analyzing the year-to-date figures:
                                    - YTD March 2023: 35.0% (N60,385,711,000 / N172,478,412,000)
                                    - YTD March 2022: 35.9% (N57,182,237,000 / N159,444,503,000)
                                    This shows a decrease of 0.9 percentage points in gross profit margin.
